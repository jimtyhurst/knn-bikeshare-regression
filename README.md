## Overview

The [Capital bikeshare dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/) used in this project is licensed from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/):

    H. Fanaee-T. "Bike Sharing," UCI Machine Learning Repository, 2013. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5W894.

The purpose of the exercise is to use historical data to predict the number of bike rentals on a given day, given weather and other features of the model. The code demonstrates use of the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) knn regressor, [KNeighborsRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor.html) to fit the data and to make a prediction.
